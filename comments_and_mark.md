In this report “Exploring Yelp Data – Sentiment Analysis and Analysing Elite Users” the author presented different types of data analysis for the Yelp Reviews dataset.

The introduction provides background and motivation, and briefly defines research goals. The research goals could have been described more clearly. The research goals could have been more focused by covering a few questions and studying them more deeply. 

The solution concept is based on using PySpark to perform different types of data analytics, including Spark SQL queries, sentiment prediction using logistic regression and other machine learning models, and evaluating different social network node centrality measures. The key solution concepts used are discussed before being used, e.g. in Section 3, which is good.

The implementation involved writing PySpark code using various APIs and libraries available in Spark. The code is well structured and commented as appropriate. 

The dataset is the Yelp Review Dataset. The dataset is appropriate for the given study. The dataset is well described in Section 1.1. 

The numerical evaluation involved presenting results of various queries, either in a tabular form or by using data visualisations. Standard metrics for evaluation of binary classifiers are used to evaluate performance of different machine learning algorithms used. The numerical evaluation is comprehensive. It could have been focused more on distributed computation aspects of the computations performed, and going more deeply in explaining obtained results. Some results pertinent to distributed computation are discussed in the last section, but to a limited extent. The performance obtained by doubling the number of worker nodes (from 2 to 4) yielded only a 13.33% parallel computation speedup. This could have been analysed more deeply. 

The conclusion section is very detailed. It contains a discussion of the actual results obtained, which is good. The conclusion could have been more succinct.

The presentation quality is overall good. The report is long and contains a lot of material. The report could have been more focussed and succinct.
